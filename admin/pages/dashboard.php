			Welcome to the new and improved Zap Hotel Housekeeping. We have made several major changes, some of which are: <br />
			- Complete logging is now in place, which means that anything you do is logged. We can see everything now. <br />
			- The banned user list now has search functionality & pages instead of loading 3000 at once. <br />
			- The overall design of the HK has been drastically improved. <br /> <br />
			The housekeeping is no longer available to Moderators or below, it is strictly admin access only, thankyou.
